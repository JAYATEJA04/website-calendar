How can I contribute?
You can fix the typos (if any) in any documentation of this repo.
You can check for any unassigned issues and comment on that issue that you'd like to get that issue assigned to you. (Remember: Do not work on issues assigned to someone else and do not work on any issue without having it assigned to you.)
Create issue if you see any bug and then once you get approved from the admins, you can assign yourself and start working on it.
